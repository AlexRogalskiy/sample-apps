# Wordpress

This repo is derived from the Docker official repository for wordpress. The README contents from
the original repo are available under 'About this Repo' section.

We have updated the php5.6/apache folder for deploying Wordpress with CloudARK. Specifically,
we have added environment yaml file to define cloud environment for Wordpress. And we have
updated the original Dockerfile to set database related environment variables based on
the environment that will be created.

# Deploy on GKE

$ cd php5.6/apache

Open environment-cloudsql-gke.yaml and set value for project attribute. It needs to be ID of gcloud project.
You can create a project from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com

$ cld env create staging environment-cloudsql-gke.yaml

$ cld container create cont1 gcr

$ cld container show cont1

Edit app-gke.yaml to include image url obtained from output of
cld container show command

$ cld app deploy wordpress staging app-gke.yaml

$ cld app show wordpress


# Deploy on ECS

$ cd php5.6/apache

$ cld env create staging environment-rds-ecs.yaml

$ cld container create cont2 ecr

$ cld container show cont2

Edit app-ecs.yaml to include image url obtained from output of
cld container show command

$ cld app deploy wordpress staging app-ecs.yaml


You can see all the resources created as part of environment creation and app deployment
through Google Cloud console or AWS console.

Screenshots of wordpress deployment available in the README at: https://github.com/cloud-ark/cloudark
