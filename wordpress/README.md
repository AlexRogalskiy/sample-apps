# Wordpress

This repo is derived from the Docker official repository for wordpress. The README contents from
the original repo are available under 'About this Repo' section.

We have updated the php5.6/apache folder for deploying Wordpress with CloudARK. Specifically,
we have added environment yaml file to define cloud environment for Wordpress. And we have
updated the original Dockerfile to set database related environment variables based on
the environment that will be created.

# Deploy using CloudARK

$ cd php5.6/apache

$ cld env create staging environment-rds-ecs.yaml

$ cld app deploy wordpress env-id --memory 1000

'cld env create' creates an environment consisting of ECS cluster and a RDS instance.
'cld app deploy' then takes the env-id and deploys wordpress on ECS cluster binding
the application container to the RDS instance.

Creating the environment may take approximately 10 minutes (more or less, depending upon
speed of your Internet connection). The time is dominated by
the time taken to create the RDS instance. You will be able to deploy application on the environment
only after it becomes 'available'. App deployment may take approximately 4/5 minutes.

You can see all the resources created as part of environment creation and app deployment
through the AWS console.
